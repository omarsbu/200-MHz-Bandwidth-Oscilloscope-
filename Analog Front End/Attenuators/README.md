=> Attenuators increase the input range of the scope by allowing signals with large amplitudes to be scaled down to within the ADC input range. 

=> Input range is reduced in 50 ohm mode due to larger power dissipation in the resistors. Higher power resistors can be used to increase the input range, however, physically larger resistors will have larger parasitics, which reduces high frequency performance of the 50 ohm path, which what it is intended for.
