The purpose of an analog front end is to condition the input signal so that it maximizes the ADC’s dynamic range and limits the bandwidth to the ADC’s Nyquist frequency. Attenuators extend the measurable range by scaling down large input signals to within the appropriate voltage range and a programmable gain amplifier boosts small signals so they make full use of the ADC’s resolution. DC offsetting is also applied to bias the signal so that it fits well within the ADC’s input range. A high impedance JFET LNA buffer allows the oscilloscope input to be terminated with 1 MΩ or 50 Ω impedance.

The input stage of each channel consists of a set of relay switches to select between AC and DC coupling, as well as different attenuation levels. A compensated 1 MΩ L-pad attenuator is used for normal measurements with standard probes, while 50 Ω pi-attenuators are used for high-fidelity measurements from a 50 Ω source. Protection diodes clamp the input voltage if it exceeds the positive or negative supply rails.

The BUF802 is used in conjunction with the OPA140 to form a composite amplifier with good performance at high and low frequencies.
