=> Impedance Converter serves as a buffer, presenting a 50G立 input impedance and a driving the output with 50立 output impedance. 

=> Large input impedance allows input impedance to be terminated with 1M立 or 50立.

=> Composite amplifier formed with OPA140 which has high DC precision and BUF802 which has high superior AC performance.
